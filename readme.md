# Workflowy Hacks

Workflowy is an incredibly versatile online outliner and productivity tool.

It is important to note that not a single one of these extensions, hacks, or modifications to Workflowy are endorsed by the creators of Workflowy and absolutely no warranty is expressed or implied by their being hosted in this repository or on external sites that this links to. Let the buyer beware — *use at your own risk*. They may quit working at any time or cause your computer or device to explode into a smoldering pile of rubble.

But they're pretty cool in the meantime.

## Supporting Workflowy

While Workflowy is free to use, I would encourage any user to sign up for Workflowy Pro and support the product going forwards. It's a minimal monthly charge and totally worth it (IMHO).

## Workflowy Book

A user has created a fantastic ebook on Workflowy.

 - Do Way Way Way More with Workflowy

## How To's

 - List of great how to's and beginner resources.

## Stylish Hacks

Stylish is a browser extension that applies user styles to Web pages. A lot of features and functionality can be brought to Workflowy by the simple application of some custom CSS.

There's a growing collection of styles on this site.

### CSS Sources for Some of the CSS Hacks.

Collection of CSS experiments and themes stolen from https://userstyles.org.

Ported here, some originals, and hoping to consolidate user / hackers

## Bookmarklets

A Bookmarklet is a small snippet of JavaScript that can be saved in your bookmarks / favorites list and executed against the current Web page to add or modify features, functionality, or even the UI.

## Browser Extensions

Each Web browser has its own concept of plugins or extensions. Mozilla is currently in the process of altering it's Add-on configuration to be more compliant with the Chrome Web Extensions package system.

### Chrome Extensions

 - Copy Link to Workflowy
 - Insert Google Calendar Event

# Longer Term

I would love to begin to create a user community around Workflowy that helps other users, and adds to the rich ecosystem and platform already created through the creators of Workflowy.
